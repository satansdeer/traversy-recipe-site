          <p>
            Zucchini Provolone Pasta. Summer bounty is in our fresh vegetables
            and fruits which are gracing our grocery stores and fresh farmers’
            markets. Zucchini is one of our favorites as well as being one of
            the most versatile, in my opinion, vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then there is cheese. A day without cheese for me is like a day
            without coffee or ice cream, or salad, you catch my drift. Smoked
            provolone is one of my favorites. Not easy to found thus when the
            market has some, it comes home with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put to good use with this recipe, the provolone adds some extra
            depth to the pasta. As it melts it created a wonderful cream with
            envelops the pasta with lots of flavors.
